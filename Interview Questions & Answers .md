## 🟢 Beginner Level (10 Questions & Answers)

### **1. What is Six Sigma?**
**Answer:**  
Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology focused on reducing defects and improving process performance by identifying variation and eliminating root causes.

### **2. What is the DMAIC cycle?**
**Answer:**  
DMAIC stands for **Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control** — the core improvement framework used in Six Sigma.

### **3. What is a defect?**
**Answer:**  
A defect is any output that does not meet customer requirements or fails to meet the defined CTQs.

### **4. What does DPMO mean?**
**Answer:**  
DPMO stands for **Defects Per Million Opportunities**, a metric used to measure process performance.

### **5. What is CTQ?**
**Answer:**  
CTQ means **Critical to Quality**, representing customer requirements that must be met for satisfaction.

### **6. What is the role of a Green Belt?**
**Answer:**  
A Green Belt leads improvement projects part-time, performs data analysis, and applies DMAIC tools.

### **7. What is a process map?**
**Answer:**  
A flowchart that visually represents the steps in a process to identify gaps, delays, and waste.

### **8. What is variation?**
**Answer:**  
Variation refers to differences in process output. Six Sigma aims to reduce undesirable variation.

### **9. What is 5S?**
**Answer:**  
A Lean tool for workplace organization:
Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain.

### **10. What is a fishbone diagram?**
**Answer:**  
Also known as the **Ishikawa diagram**, it helps identify possible root causes of a problem.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level (10 Questions & Answers)

### **1. What is the difference between Lean and Six Sigma?**
**Answer:**  
Lean removes waste to improve speed; Six Sigma reduces variation to improve quality. Together, they provide a comprehensive improvement method.

### **2. What is a KPI in Six Sigma?**
**Answer:**  
Key Performance Indicators measure process success (e.g., cycle time, defect rate, cost).

### **3. What is Process Capability (Cp, Cpk)?**
**Answer:**  
Cp measures the potential capability of a process;  
Cpk measures how centered the process is within specification limits.

### **4. Explain FMEA.**
**Answer:**  
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis identifies potential failure points, assesses risk, and prioritizes mitigation.

### **5. What is the purpose of a control chart?**
**Answer:**  
To monitor process stability using upper and lower control limits.

### **6. What is the difference between UCL/LCL and USL/LSL?**
**Answer:**  
- **UCL/LCL:** Statistical limits determined by process behavior.  
- **USL/LSL:** Customer-defined specification limits.

### **7. What is hypothesis testing?**
**Answer:**  
A statistical method to determine if a claim or assumption about a population is true based on sample data.

### **8. What is a Kaizen event?**
**Answer:**  
A short, focused improvement workshop aimed at solving a specific process problem quickly.

### **9. What is a Value Stream Map (VSM)?**
**Answer:**  
A Lean tool that visualizes the current and future state of a process, identifying waste and improvement opportunities.

### **10. What is the difference between common cause and special cause variation?**
**Answer:**  
- Common cause: natural, built-in process variation.  
- Special cause: unusual variation from specific external factors.

## 🔴 Advanced Level (10 Questions & Answers)

### **1. How do you select projects for Six Sigma?**
**Answer:**  
Projects are selected based on business impact, feasibility, alignment with strategic goals, and potential financial return.

### **2. Explain the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in Six Sigma.**
**Answer:**  
CLT states that as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean becomes normally distributed, regardless of population distribution.

### **3. What is Design of Experiments (DOE)?**
**Answer:**  
DOE tests multiple variables simultaneously to understand their impact on output and identify optimal conditions.

### **4. How do you validate root causes statistically?**
**Answer:**  
Using hypothesis tests, regression, correlation, ANOVA, and confidence intervals.

### **5. What is a regression analysis used for?**
**Answer:**  
To determine relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

### **6. What is the P-value?**
**Answer:**  
A P-value measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.  
Typically, **p < 0.05** indicates statistically significant results.

### **7. How do you calculate sigma level?**
**Answer:**  
Using DPMO or Z-score tables to determine the process performance level.

### **8. What are control plans, and why are they crucial?**
**Answer:**  
Control plans document how a process will be monitored and maintained after improvements to ensure long-term stability.

### **9. Explain multicollinearity in regression.**
**Answer:**  
It occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, which distorts model accuracy.

### **10. How do you ensure financial validation of savings?**
**Answer:**  
Savings must be verified with finance teams using validated baseline data, cost models, and actual improvement results.
